# Conversion-of-Business-Questions-to-SQL-Queries-by-Pretrained-Model-Using-LangChain
This project aims to convert business questions to Database SQL queries to solve business problems

# Business Problem
Manual SQL queries are time-consuming and require technical expertise.
Non-technical users struggle to access valuable data insights.
Inefficient use of data analysts' time.
# Resolution 
using Large Language Model (LLM) to bridge natural language and SQL.
The LLM translates the user-asked questions into accurate SQL queries

# Few Shot Learning
Few-shot learning is like training a foundational model to learn new things quickly, even with just a few examples.
In the project trained Google PLAM to understand car data and translate user questions into SQL queries, all with a relatively small dataset of questions and their corresponding SQL answers. 
This makes it faster and cheaper to train the model and allows you to easily adapt it to handle new types of questions about the car inventory data.
