# Conversion-of-Business-Questions-to-SQL-Queries-by-Pretrained-Model-Using-LangChain
This project aims to convert business questions to Database SQL queries to solve business problems

# Business Problem
- Manual SQL queries are time-consuming and require technical expertise.
- Non-technical users struggle to access valuable data insights.
- Inefficient use of data analysts' time.
# Resolution 
- using Large Language Model (LLM) to bridge natural language and SQL.
- The LLM translates the user-asked questions into accurate SQL queries

# Few Shot Learning
- Few-shot learning is like training a foundational model to learn new things quickly, even with just a few examples.
- In the project trained Google PLAM to understand car data and translate user questions into SQL queries, all with a relatively small dataset of questions and their corresponding SQL answers. 
- This makes it faster and cheaper to train the model and allows you to easily adapt it to handle new types of questions about the car inventory data.
